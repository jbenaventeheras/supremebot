# Supreme_Bot
A bot that inputs all of the user information when given a link to a product on the Supreme site. 

## IMPORTANT NOTE
This is a Supreme bot that may or may not work. Little testing has 
been done to check if this will not be caught by Supreme's bot
detection. More is being worked on to make it more efficient: 
current execution time of approx 7 seconds depending on internet 
connection. I am also not liable for loss of personal information, 
damage to personal identity, or ban from the Supreme site (if 
you choose to use this bot for purchasing products).   

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR PURCHASING AS YOU MAY BE BANNED FOR 
USING THIS SOFTWARE BY SUPREME.**

### Important Note Pt.2 
bot.py, config.py, and keys.txt must all be in the same directory
in order to work. 

For keys.txt, edit current names and placeholders to suit the user's 
information.
